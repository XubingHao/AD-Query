# An Ontology-based Approach for Harmonization and Cross-cohort Query of Alzheimer's Disease Data Resources
This repository contains the mapped data elements between National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Disease Data Element Ontology (ADEO).

- The ADEO.owl is the source file of our Alzheimer's Disease Data Element Ontology (ADEO). 
- The AD_concepts folder contains the results of data element mapping and coding inconsistency harmonization between NACC and ADNI. 
- The concepts file stores the mapped data elements between NACC and ADNI which are also used as concepts in ADEO. 
- The variables file stores the original name of the mapped data elements in NACC and ADNI. 
- The variables_concept_mapping file stores the correspondence between ADEO concepts and original data elements names. 
- The inconsistency file stores the harmonization of inconsistent concept codes. 
- The domain file stores the displayed name of different concept codes.
